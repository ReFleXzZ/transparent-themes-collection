# Transparent Themes Collection

## Introduction

You wanna have some nice colors with transparent background?

Now you're at the right place! ðŸ¥³

This extension is (or rather *will* be) a collection of themes with transparent backgrounds which should also work well without transparency. (not tested)

## Requirements:

### Linux

You will need a VS Code version which supports transparency. For Arch Users [this](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/code-translucent) AUR package will do it.

### MacOS

There should be an extension for MacOS, enabling background transparency. But since I don't use Apple products I have absolutely no clue.

### Windows

Also not sure, since I didn't try it. Maybe you will need

1. an transparency enabling extension
2. which may be used in conjunction with [Mica for Everyone!](https://github.com/MicaForEveryone/MicaForEveryone)

> [!WARNING]
> I don't know this, it's just an idea which may (or may not) work.

## Included Themes

#### **Ayu Darkvenom**:

This is a mix from the transparent color theme and ayu darkvenom from \"Best Themes Redefined\". While keeping the token colors from Ayu Darkvenom, this theme tries to make everything else transparent without borders."

## Known Quirks/Issues

I haven't already figured out how to change the coloring of the horizontal scrolling bar, so this might look a little bit off.
